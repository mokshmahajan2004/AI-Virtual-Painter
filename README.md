Welcome to the AI Virtual Painter project! This application leverages Mediapipe, OpenCV, and Python to create a virtual painting experience. By using hand gestures, users can draw on a digital canvas without the need for physical drawing tools.



## Features

- Hand Detection: Utilizes Mediapipe's hand tracking to detect and track hand movements.
- Virtual Drawing: Allows users to draw on the screen using their index finger.
- Color Selection: Provides options to change the drawing color with simple hand gestures.
- Eraser Functionality: Erase parts of the drawing using a specific hand gesture
